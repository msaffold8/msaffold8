# Hi, 👋🏾 I'm Mel! 

I'm a software developer with a growth mindset, always ready to take on challenges. I am driven by self-motivation and teamwork. I have a genuine passion for continuous learning and have consistently thrived in high-pressure, fast-paced environments due to my ability to quickly pick up diverse concepts. Currently transitioning from a Product Manager role, I'm actively seeking opportunities that allow me to build upon my strengths.

- 💻 Currently working on fullstack web applications with React, JS, Tailwind, Node, and SQL.
- 🧐 Currently learning AWS, AI, TypeScript, MySQL, and MongoDB. 
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on entrepreneurial opportunites and innovative ideas. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything tech-related!
